[![Packagist Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/xpaw/php-source-query-class.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/xpaw/php-source-query-class)

This class was created to query game server which use the Source query protocol, this includes all source games, and all the games that implement Steamworks.

The class also allows you to query servers using RCON although this only works for half-life 1 and source engine games.

[Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net) also uses Source RCON protocol, and this means you can use this class to send commands to your minecraft server while having engine set to Source engine.

**:warning: Do not send me emails if this does not work for you, I will not help you.**

Open a pull request if you know another game which supports Source Query and/or RCON protocols.

## How to tell if the game supports Source Query Protocol?

Add your server to your favourites in Steam server browser, and if Steam can display information about your server, then the protocol is supported.
